# Web-based Apartment Sales System

The Apartment Selling System is a Java-based web application designed to streamline the
process of buying and managing apartments. It aims to provide an efficient, user-friendly
platform that simplifies apartment searches, facilitates online bookings, and enables secure
reservations & buying. By leveraging software engineering principles and the Software
Development Life Cycle (SDLC), the project will deliver a functional prototype that
addresses real-world user requirements, enhancing both user experience and operational
efficiency in the apartment sales process.
